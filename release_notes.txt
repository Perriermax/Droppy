# Droppy v2.7.3: The Liquid Update 🌊

This release introduces a completely redesigned, custom-built Update Screen that matches the premium "Liquid Glass" aesthetic of Droppy.

### ✨ New Features & Improvements:

- **Refined Clipboard Empty States**: New "Scissors" and "Document" iconography for the Clipboard Manager when no items are present or selected.
- **Enhanced Markdown Support**: Release notes now render beautifully with support for bold, italics, lists, and quotes, ensuring you're always informed about what's new.
- **Silky Smooth Animations**: Unified hover and interaction physics across all windows for a more cohesive experience.
